[Seattle University](https://www.seattleu.edu) became one of the first clients to implement TerminalFour's newest major release, which was a large upgrade from version 7. The documentation on the CMS was not accessible to non-administrative content editors and had not caught up to version 8.0, which made it less than ideal to use as a resource for ~250 campus content editors. 

Instead of trying to rewrite outdated material, I [organized and wrote all new support articles](https://www.seattleu.edu/web/training/), using the help library in conjunction with an optional one-hour training class I developed and taught roughly 30 times in December 2015 and May through August 2016. 

As the first person in the web support specialist role, I was the point person for department and institute site overhauls and follow-up TerminalFour technical questions. By [empowering users](https://boingboing.net/2015/02/27/kathy-sierras-badass-how-to.html) to creatively update their websites, I was able to free the rest of Seattle University's tiny web team from spending time on support requests.
