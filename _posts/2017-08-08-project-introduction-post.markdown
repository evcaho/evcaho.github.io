I've been learning Ruby on Rails, and created a small mixtape database that used the rails method '''has_many through'''. The project allows you to create a mixtape and add songs to it. Songs can belong to different mixtapes through the '''membership''' model, so tapes do not act as parents of the song children. This project gave me a chance to try out database design.
