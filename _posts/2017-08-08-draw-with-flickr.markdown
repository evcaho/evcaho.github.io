Through the [web development](https://ncs.seattleu.edu/programs-courses/web-development/) certificate at Seattle U, I created an app that allows you to search Flickr for a search term of your choice and then use that picture as a paintbrush. I'm generally interested in tiny, interactive web apps that delight users, and this was my rudimentary take. Users can draw by moving the mouse over the picture frame, and disable drawing by holding the mouse down.
