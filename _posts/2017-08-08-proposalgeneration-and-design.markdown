From 2011 to 2014, I worked as a technical editor for an environmental and consulting firm. Because their primary deliverable to clients were environmental reports, I developed complex editorial calendars and coordinated deliverables across 10+ multi-disciplinary project teams. What this means in English: I designed and edited creative proposals for multi-million dollar environmental projects, edited huge environmetal planning and engineering reports (a picture of one of my biggest is here), and switched styles and guidelines on a whim. 

At Anchor QEA, I learned how much I loved working with different disciplines to create deliverables that exceeded both client and agency expectations.
