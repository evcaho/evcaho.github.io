From 2011 to 2014, I worked as a technical editor for an environmental consulting firm. Because their primary deliverables to clients were environmental reports, I developed complex editorial calendars and coordinated deliverables across 10+ concurrent, multi-disciplinary projects. 

**What this means in English:** I designed and edited creative proposals for multi-million dollar environmental projects, edited huge environmetal planning and engineering reports, and had to quickly switched styles and guidelines between projects. I got **really** good at manipulating Word act like Adobe InDesign, which I do not recommend to anyone.

Here's what one of my larger reports looked like when printed (this one was 300 pages, plus ten appendices containing charts, GIS images, and further assessments):

At Anchor QEA, I learned how much I loved working with different disciplines to create deliverables that exceeded both client and agency expectations.
