<p>Hi! I'm Evie (eh-vee), a technical writer and newbie developer in Seattle. I started my career for a small retail and online store in Seattle, and the customer service values I learned there never left me. I'm obsessed with creating helpful content for users and developers, and have brought my skills to roles in technical editing, writing user support documents, and developing and teaching software training. In 2013, I earned a certificate in Technical Writing and Editing from the University of Washington, and spent the latter half of 2016 teaching myself programming with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>If all of this sounds a bit jumbled, it's because it is. I'm continuously evolving and learning more skills to keep up with an ever-changing industry. Each of my roles has required some out-of-the-box thinking to solve pesky technical problems, and I love figuring out how to help people out, no matter who they are or what technology that entails.</p>
